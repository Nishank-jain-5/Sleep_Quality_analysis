# Sleep Quality Analysis Project
### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sleep quality and its relationship with various attributes using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The aim is to uncover patterns and factors that may impact sleep quality, using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques. Understanding these relationships can provide insights into how different health and lifestyle factors contribute to better or worse sleep, potentially guiding recommendations for improved sleep health.

### Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Dataset Name: Health and Sleep Statistics
Description: This dataset includes various attributes related to individuals' health, lifestyle, and demographics, as well as metrics on sleep quality, duration, and consistency.

### Attributes:
User ID: An individual's unique identification number.

Age: The age of the individual.

Gender: The sex of the individual ('f' female, 'm' male)

Sleep Quality: The quality of an individual's sleep (a scale of 1-10, with 10 indicating the highest quality)

Bedtime: The individual's bedtime (in 24-hour format)

Wake-up Time: The individual's wake-up time (in 24-hour format)

Daily Steps: Number of steps per day

Calories Burned: The amount of calories burned per day

Physical Activity Level: The individual's physical activity level (low, medium, high)

Dietary Habits: Dietary habits of the individual (healthy, medium, unhealthy)

Sleep Disorders: Whether the individual has sleep disorders (yes, no)

Medication Usage: Whether the individual uses medication for sleep disorders (yes, no)

Explanation: These data are imaginary data. It was created entirely for the purpose of improving users, it has nothing to do with reality.

### Project Goals
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and standardize data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze trends and correlations between sleep quality and other attributes.

Feature Engineering: Create new features if necessary to improve model performance.

Model Building: Build predictive models to forecast sleep quality based on health and lifestyle attributes.

Results Interpretation: Interpret model results and identify key attributes that impact sleep quality.

Visualization: Present findings in clear, informative visuals.

### Usage
Data Exploration: Start by opening the EDA.ipynb notebook to explore the dataset and gain insights.
Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Run data_preprocessing.py and feature_engineering.py for cleaning and enhancing the dataset.

Model Building: Use the ModelBuilding.ipynb notebook or the model.py script to train and evaluate predictive models.

Analysis and Visualization: Review generated plots and model outputs in the results/plots and results/model_results directories.

### Results
This analysis should yield:

- Correlations and Trends: Relationships between sleep quality and health or lifestyle factors.
- Key Influencing Factors: Identification of the most significant attributes affecting sleep quality.
- Model Accuracy: Performance metrics of models trained to predict sleep quality.
- Visual Insights: Graphical representation of findings to communicate insights effectively.
